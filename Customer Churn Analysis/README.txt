Customer Churn Prediction

Overview

This project predicts customer churn for a telecom company using machine learning. By analyzing customer data, we identify patterns that lead to churn and build a model to predict future churners.

Steps

1. Data Preprocessing:

Handled missing values.

Encoded categorical columns.

Scaled numerical features.



2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Visualized churn patterns.

Identified key factors affecting churn.



3. Model Building:

Trained models like Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost.

Evaluated performance using accuracy and F1-score.



4. Visualization:

Plots showing churn trends and model evaluation.

Results

The best model achieved an accuracy of X%.

Key insights:

Customers with higher monthly charges and shorter tenures are more likely to churn.

Long-term contracts reduce churn probability.
