Titanic Survival Prediction

Project Overview

This project predicts whether a passenger on the Titanic survived or not based on features such as age, gender, class, and fare. The dataset is from Kaggle's Titanic challenge.

Steps in the Project

1. Data Exploration: Analyzed the dataset to understand survival trends.


2. Data Preprocessing: Handled missing values and converted categorical data to numeric.


3. Model Training: Tested machine learning models like Logistic Regression and Random Forest.


4. Evaluation: Selected the best model based on accuracy.


5. Prediction: Generated survival predictions for test data.
